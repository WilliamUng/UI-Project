                <p style="font-size:120%;">The first Destiny raid took 14 hours to figure out. Forsaken’s Last Wish raid? 19 hours. But after 27 hours, Niobe Labs was still unsolved. And it was becoming a problem for Bungie. This is the story of how it all went down.</p>
</p>
				<h2> NIOBE LABS, THE BIGGEST DESTINY PUZZLE TO DATE</h2>
				<p style="font-size:120%;">Since the schedule for Black Armory dropped in late November, speculation about what Niobe Labs could be has circled the Destiny community. Some players thought it could be another dungeon like Shattered Throne, after spotting it on the roadmap for seemingly no reason. Others thought that it was the name of the fourth and final forge.

Instead, Bungie revealed that the completion of Niobe Labs would unlock the fourth and final Black Armory forge: Bergusia. Players ventured into the EDZ location to try becoming the first team to unlock content for the entire community.

A quick sparrow ride took them to a chasm that has existed in Destiny 2 since the game launched back in 2017. But where there was once a bottomless pit, there was now a makeshift bridge. One short journey into unknown territory later, players dropped into Niobe Labs for the first time.

A giant bunker, Niobe Labs looked fairly inconspicuous to the naked eye. But like a few other Black Armory locations, it was littered with hidden symbols (visible only by looking through the scopes of specific weapons). After a few hours of scouring the lab for clues, teams finally figured out how to start the event that would eventually split the community. </p>
