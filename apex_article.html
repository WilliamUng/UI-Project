                <p style="font-size:120%;">What kind of game can take on Fortnite, the battle royale sensation that shook the videogame industry in 2018? Maybe another battle royale sensation—this time, from Electronic Arts (EA)

Tae Kim covered the unexpected launch of Apex Legendsfor Barron’s, noting the excitement it generated while cautioning against overenthusiasm. Some analysts see it as a potentially meaningful source of revenue for EA, though perhaps not until next year.

Still, reviewers have been largely positive about the game, calling it a welcome addition to an inescapable genre of shooting game.

“It’s a fantastic riff on the genre and the freshest take on an already-established subset of games we’ve seen in quite some time,” wrote Brittany Vincent in Esquire. “While Apex Legends has the same fundamentals as other battle royales, it’s just different enough to feel unique instead of derivative. And that’s perfect for Fortnite veterans who’ve grown weary of Tomato Town or Loot Llamas or that relentless Technicolor aesthetic.”

Destructoid’s Dan Roemer offered a useful primer of Apex Legends, which pits 20 teams of three players, each of whom must be a different “Legend”—roughly, a character with its own set of abilities—against each other.

“In my time with Apex, I managed to squeeze in numerous matches with every legend on the roster, whether I’m bamboozling enemies with holograms as Mirage or slipping in and out of reality itself with Wraith,” Roemer wrote. “Every legend has a notable use or function within a squad and experimenting with a variety of squad selections tended to always result in an interesting combination of abilities that could potentially change up strategies from match-to-match.”

• That might seem like inflexibility—but it works, wrote Gamereactor’s Mike Holmes.

“Beyond the far-future sci-fi setting, the thing that really sets Apex apart is the structure of the matches,” he wrote. “The games are exclusively (at least at the time of writing) for three-player teams and there are no options for solo play, duos, or teams larger than three. But, as the old saying goes, three is the magic number, and this hard limit ensures that each encounter is far more tactical than your typical last player standing shooter.”

• It matters which Legend you pick, writes Game Revolution’s Paul Tamburro, but not too much.

“I found it easy to overlook my characters’ abilities when firing my gun was routinely the easier option, and some of the ultimates are largely forgettable, such as Mirage’s ability to have five holograms of himself idly stand around in a circle,” he wrote. “But their underwhelming abilities aside, the Legends themselves are a memorable and diverse bunch, offering a little something for everyone including the presence of two LGBTQ+ characters.”
